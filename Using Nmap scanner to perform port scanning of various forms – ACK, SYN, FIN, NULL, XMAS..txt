AIM : Using Nmap scanner to perform port scanning of various forms – ACK, SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS.

NOTE: Install Nmap for windows and install it. After that open cmd and type “nmap” to check if it is installed properly. 
Now type the below commands.

-> ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan)
It never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they are stateful 
or not and which ports are filtered.
Command:- nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org

-> SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS)
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per 
second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls.
Command:- nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org

-> FIN Scan (-sF)
Sets just the TCP FIN bit. Command: nmap -sF -T4 para

-> NULL Scan (-sN)
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0) Command: nmap –sN –p 22 scanme.nmap.org

-> XMAS Scan (-sX)
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree. Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org
